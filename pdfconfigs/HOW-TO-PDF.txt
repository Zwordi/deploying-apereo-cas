## How To Create PDFs

Briefly, here are the steps:

1. Set up and install Prince (http://www.princexml.com/doc/installing/).
   Read the licensing requirements in detail, but chances are you can install
   a version for free.

2. Stop any running instances of Jekyll.

3. Edit "pdfconfgs/config_xxx_pdf.yml" and set properties to your taste.

4. From the top-level directory, start a special instance of Jekyll using both
   "_config.yml" and "pdfconfigs/config_xxx_pdf.yml":

   $ bundle exec jekyll serve --detach --config \
      _config.yml,pdfconfigs/config_xxx_pdf.yml;

   Note that the "--detach" option does not work on Windows.

5. From the top-level directory, run Prince to generate the PDF file:

   $ prince --javascript --input-list=_site/pdfconfigs/prince-list.txt \
       -o pdf/xxx.pdf;

   On Windows, you should use the Prince engine, not the Prince GUI. To do
   this, add Prince's `bin` directory to your path:

   $ PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files (x86)/Prince/Engine/bin"

PDF files:
