## Our history

In 1919, a few great minds imagined a school that would rethink the purpose of higher learning. The New School is an amalgamation of a world-famous design school, a premier liberal arts college, a renowned performing arts school, a legendary social research school, and other advanced degree programs, created to challenge and support freethinkers who want to change the world.

No matter what your age or stage of life, you can find more to learn at The New School. With over 135 undergraduate and graduate degree programs, our university offers a more creatively inspired, rigorously relevant education than any other. Our university's urban academic centers in New York City, Paris, and Mumbai offer almost 10,000 students the chance to expand their knowledge and view of the world.

## Our schools

No matter what area of study students pursue at The New School, they will discover a unique form of creative problem solving that will forever change the way they investigate and create. They will learn to relentlessly question convention, collaborate across disciplines, and take risks. They will immerse themselves in a world of critical analysis and intense scholarship. And ultimately, they will seek new ways to effect positive change. Five progressive colleges inspire world-changing creativity:

* Parsons School of Design
* Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts
* College of Performing Arts
* The New School for Social Research
* Schools of Public Engagement
